const { orgId } = useParams()

// Get an entity from the redux store, if it does not exist yet, fetch it.
// Hence the reason for providing data, loading and error states, extracted from a redux selector.
const { data, loading, error } = useEntity('organization', orgId)
const { data, loading, error } = useCollection('campaign', organizationId)
