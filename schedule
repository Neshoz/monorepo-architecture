Schedule for 2-3 weeks
1: New devserver (Vite) - Not possible right now, since it requires Node version > 12.0.0
2: Build script for packages (Rollup or esbuild) - Might go with esbuild
3: Evaluate structure & find potential pain-points - Have another tech talk about it, present a more elaborate example (network reqs etc)
4: Test it in Mediatool - Move existing stuff to @Mediatool/legacy
Nice-to-have: Docker
